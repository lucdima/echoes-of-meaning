When I am confronted with AI, I feel both excited and still somehow intimidated. There’s a program called DeepL – an AI-based translation tool – and I often interact with it because I’m taking an English course, actually two of them. We work with real English newspapers, like Read On High Street.
We have to translate really challenging, complex articles. I use the program for that. I sit in my room, take my iPhone or iPad, start the app, and try to translate the text by myself.
Are there any emotions that come up? Yes – definitely. I feel doubtful: “Can I do this?” “Is this too hard?” “How many paragraphs are left?” “Will I ever be done?” My head is buzzing, working non-stop as I try to get through it.
I’m missing a lot of vocabulary, so I have to use the program repeatedly. There’s even a function where you can take a photo of the text, and it translates it – but it’s not a good translation.
You have to do a lot of editing. You really need to understand what the text is about. And once I finally get through it, I feel so relieved and honestly happy.
When I’ve got a working version, I copy it into another program to clean it up further. I don’t write anything by hand. Once I’m done and the text is saved on my iPad, I take a deep breath. But the job isn’t over yet – I still need to refine the translation.
I go line by line, word by word, comparing what I wrote with what the original said. I need to polish the translation, shape it until it fits.
And when it’s finally done, I feel completely at ease, close everything, and just… say nothing. Then I wait – to see how it will turn out, whether I’ve done a good job. That part feels so satisfying.
There are really two dominant feelings: first, this sense of being overwhelmed, and then this wave of relief.
And then comes this feeling of strength. Like… “Yes, I did it.” Should I say that? Well, I just feel capable.
But getting started is always the hard part. I have to overcome that block, that inner resistance. Once I’m into it, I’m okay. But getting there – that’s a journey in itself.
When we talk about emotions, there are so many theories. And people don’t really talk about emotions that much. But they’re there – and they can really guide us.
Can I name two emotions? The first one is being shocked, even a bit disgusted or anxious. Like: “My God, how much is there to translate? When will it end?” That feeling starts in my head – I can literally feel the stress.
And the other emotion? It’s more content, calm, curious, joyful, ready. It’s like a whole range opens up. It’s a more welcoming, softer state. That’s mostly in the head too.
There was another situation. I had downloaded ChatGPT and was wondering: “What can this thing actually do?” So I asked it to write a welcome speech for two friends, Isar and Beate. And it did!
Funny thing – Beate had never even been to one of our events. There was no connection. But the AI wrote: “We are especially pleased to welcome Beate.” I was curious, then happy, and then truly amazed that such a tool exists.
At first, I was just surprised. But then I was delighted, even a bit moved.
Sure, I hadn't given any specific adjectives in the prompt – maybe it just pulled something from my computer. Either way, it was astonishing.
The emotions? Definitely curiosity, then surprise, and finally, a real sense of wonder.
Where did I feel those? My excitement is usually in my head – but it can be all over the body. A small amount of stress, yes – but overall, it was even fun.
Another memory: I lost my glasses in Poland and had to go from store to store asking if anyone had found them. I recorded my question and played it to the staff – trying to communicate despite the language barrier.
It wasn’t easy, but it worked. I felt so relieved that I could make myself understood. That moment was really… beautiful.
It’s no longer common to learn Polish at my age. I even forget how to say “hello” in Polish. Thank you, though, for the music.
(10:24 - 12:14)
 Who else would like to respond to that question? Yes, I’m reopening the emotions. You have to adjust the standby time before it turns off – it’s under the little gear icon... I actually think background music distracts us... Wait, I can’t do this... Yes, that’s the simple solution... So first... First of all, I believe that any decent software nowadays is integrated with AI. What we now define as current AI programs is mostly what the friendly person next to me just said – generating text or images, things like that.
(12:15 - 12:31)
 Okay, here’s an example. Earlier this year, I taught a course on smartphone exercises. One of the participants had run a funeral business and was now retired.
(12:32 - 13:05)
 He still earned a bit on the side by writing eulogies. He told us he had to give a funeral speech and had all the basic info about the man’s work and private life. He fed it into a chatbot and got a four-and-a-half-page eulogy back – everything down to the comma was perfect. Normally, that would have taken him two full days to write.
(13:06 - 13:36)
 That left me astonished, made me anxious, and honestly worried. Because of course, you can do a lot of good things with AI – but also a lot of harm. I read a note recently saying that journalism is being reduced to the point where half of all news is now written by AI.
(13:37 - 13:55)
 That means there’s barely any good journalistic craft left. The machine can take it all over. There are a lot of people – I don’t want to sound condescending – who just don’t think deeply about anything.
(13:56 - 14:22)
 And that leaves room for manipulation – or even direct manipulative use. That’s what’s really frightening – the technical possibilities we now face.
 Stefan, you mentioned emotions like astonishment, anxiety… can you localize those feelings in your body?
(14:22 - 14:35)
 Astonished, anxious, and worried. Yes, can you feel them somewhere...?
 I’m a fairly emotionally distant person – for me it’s all in the head. Just the head.
(14:47 - 15:00)
 Astonished, anxious, and... yes, worried – that was the third one.
(15:00 - 15:14)
 Kind of a positive shock, really – what AI is capable of. You could also call that astonishment.
(15:15 - 15:27)
 Anxious – as in, what if you’re already prone to anxiety? And worried – about potential misuse, like for propaganda purposes and so on.
(15:34 - 19:26)
 I had a problem about four weeks ago – the most crucial device powered by AI in my life, my smartphone, went missing after an evening visit.
 First came panic, shock. But then – using artificial intelligence with the help of my daughter – we could locate the phone down to the minute. It became clear that it wasn’t lost – it had been stolen. The location data made that obvious.
Even so, I felt fear – what might happen with my data?
 But I also felt a kind of relief: I didn’t have to keep searching. It wasn’t lost, it was taken, and we knew where it was. Then came hope: we went to the police and reported it. That brought new frustration, because nothing further happened.
Still, I knew what steps to take. I knew what to cancel, what to change. I was genuinely grateful that we had this tool. I knew where the phone was – not who had it, but where it was. We handed it over to the police. That gave me a sense of control again.
Yes, I didn’t use the AI myself – my daughter handled it via Google. It’s always a double-edged sword, this tracking technology.
 In this case, I was simply grateful that such a thing was possible.
And this relief, maybe even a sense of being guided? Knowing exactly what the situation was – no uncertainty.
Had I just lost it, I would have kept wondering. But now it was clear: the phone had been taken within three minutes. I had used it to make a call, placed it in an unlocked car, went back to the garden – and then it was gone.
We searched forever. Then came the certainty: it had traveled exactly 13.9 kilometers. That level of tracking gave us security. I needed to cancel everything and report the theft. Nothing happened to the phone after that, and I never got it back. We knew where it was, but not who had it – so the police couldn’t act.
(19:28 - 19:51)
 And that experience – where did you feel it?
 Very stressed, anxious, my heart... But once I knew for sure it had been stolen, I became much calmer, because now I had clarity, and I could act.
(19:52 - 20:18)
 The question is always: when do you report it? When do you block things? The moment I blocked the card, it could only be tracked until then. That was the problem — if I hadn’t blocked it so quickly, the police might have been able to act better. But I wanted to say: this kind of tracking via phone or Google program is something that’s highly controversial.
(20:18 - 20:32)
 Many people don’t want to be tracked. But in this case, it was an immense relief for me to have that possibility of tracing. So for me overall, I actually became calm once I knew what had happened to the phone.
(20:33 - 20:59)
 Was it here, or was it there? Yes, I became very hectic and uncontrolled, loud, agitated.
 – But your emotions were related to the phone, to the stolen device?
 Yes, I can say now I was angry, more like, who was it? — a bit of that feeling, you know?
(21:00 - 21:10)
 Yes, I mean, as a note about phone tracking in Germany: tracking is not allowed — it is forbidden. The police are not permitted to do that.
(21:10 - 21:41)
 If I’m in the forest, break my leg, and look for help — the police can’t just track me. I would have to send a message to, say, Kerstin, and she would be allowed to forward that to the police. Then they’d be allowed to search.
 That’s German data protection law. I was a bit annoyed that the police — who could do more — didn’t take further action. Yes, he told me he needed a court order first.
(21:41 - 21:57)
 And the case wasn’t important enough for that. Still, I have to say, for me the fact that I hadn’t lost it, that I knew it was stolen, was somehow a relief, because then I was able to take action.
(21:58 - 22:05)
 Yes, otherwise I would’ve kept searching. Getting that information was important. Yes, those were important facts.
(22:07 - 22:20)
 Of course there’s a bit of distrust, but you have to put that aside. There’s always the question: how did it happen? Who’s suspicious? But all in all, I wanted to say — this really was artificial intelligence.
(22:20 - 22:27)
 It moved minute by minute until you knew: at this moment, your phone is deactivated. Then you become curious — let’s see where it is.
(22:30 - 22:35)
 Yes, I was curious, definitely. And also worried, wondering where it was.
(22:35 - 22:49)
 – Your daughter...
 No, she unfortunately only got to it much later. I wanted to trace it myself. There are tracking apps. They told me the same day — they have it, they tracked it that day.
(22:49 - 23:03)
 But I would have had to pay a fee with my card. I couldn’t, because my phone was gone, and I couldn’t verify it. So otherwise, I could’ve reported it Sunday night already.
(23:03 - 23:13)
 These are those contradictions you run into. I simply couldn’t verify my EC card, so I couldn’t pay. There was no other way to pay.
(23:13 - 23:28)
 The next day my daughter — I have to say — we have police in the family. So we knew how to proceed. We tracked it Monday evening, but I had already deactivated the phone Sunday night.
(23:28 - 23:45)
 So the police said Tuesday morning: “If you tell us Tuesday morning that your phone was at a location Monday evening, that’s useless to us.”
 They would’ve preferred if I’d said it was at 8 am Tuesday. I had hoped the police had other options.
(23:45 - 23:57)
 They said they’re not allowed, the system doesn’t let them. I just wanted to say, tracking is a very controversial issue. I’ve tried to learn more about it myself.
(23:57 - 24:09)
 You find more and more articles on how to prevent being tracked, what measures to take.
 – You should’ve told the police: “It was a right-wing extremist.”
 – Yeah, I didn’t know that.
(24:09 - 24:22)
 – They would’ve responded in five minutes.
 – I don’t want to get into that. I just wanted to say: in that moment, even if the outcome wasn’t positive or negative, nothing more happened except some costs I’ll still have to deal with.
(24:23 - 24:32)
 And I’m relieved that I know what... exactly. It was stolen, and that allowed me to take real action. I deactivated everything, renewed everything, reinstalled everything on the phone.
(24:33 - 24:54)
 If I’d immediately known it was stolen, I could’ve said: “There’s still 3 minutes of battery.” With encryption, I could’ve done much more right away. And you’re still worried — was it an IT expert? That would be really annoying, you know?
(24:54 - 25:09)
 But now, after four weeks, I’m feeling calm, because nothing has happened. An IT specialist would’ve immediately removed the battery. But then they also couldn’t access anything — the phone would be dead to them.
(25:09 - 25:24)
 The phone has three antennas, one for satellite navigation. If you remove the battery, there’s no tracking anymore.
 – What kind of phone do you have where you can even remove the battery?
 – I can, but it’s difficult.
(25:27 - 25:41)
 It’s unbelievable — it was in a spot where there really wasn’t much... yes, I could access the forest from there and all. With those so-called senior phones, it’s still possible. I can really recommend Emporia.
(25:41 - 25:50)
 It was already a small computer for me. That’s why I also don’t want my data to be widely shared. Then there’s the cloud...
(25:51 - 25:59)
 The cloud is expensive.
 Yes, and you end up with too much. I have a laptop and a tablet too.
(25:59 - 26:05)
 But I use all that very little. I did almost everything with the phone. Because it’s always with me.
(26:05 - 26:14)
 Now I’ve started distributing things a bit differently.
 – Great, thanks Kerstin.
 – Does anyone else want to...?
 – Just one little thing.
(26:15 - 26:29)
 Ah, one moment. We should take a short break so we don’t get everything all at once. I must admit, I don’t know any foreign languages.
(26:29 - 26:41)
 Just a few English words, but not much. And it always annoyed me when I was shopping — especially with sweets and things, everything was in English.
(26:41 - 26:53)
 Or when I wanted to buy something for my grandchildren — I didn’t buy what I didn’t understand. Those translation apps? I never liked them.
(26:53 - 27:04)
 They didn’t feel right. Then my daughter said, “Mom, with Google Lens you can do everything now.” And I thought, I’d have to photograph it.
(27:04 - 27:14)
 No — you just hold it to the article, the English text, and it translates it into German. I don’t even have to take a photo. That’s how I always used to do it.
(27:14 - 27:19)
 I don’t have to delete anything anymore. That saves me time. And now I know what’s in it.
(27:19 - 27:37)
 Or what kind of article it is. Sometimes it’s clothing or stuff, and you don’t even know what it’s for. And now I’m glad I can find out so quickly and confidently — and then decide if I want to buy it or not.
(27:37 - 27:59)
 – That sounds great. What kind of feelings — relief?
 – Yes, relief. And it saves time, because I don’t have to photograph and struggle with a translation app I’m not good at. And it’s so fast. I quickly know what’s in the product.
(28:00 - 28:34)
 – Do you feel that relief in your body somewhere? You said something earlier...
 – Yes, I forgot what I said.
 – Relief?
 – Yes, I’m glad it’s so fast.
 – Can you say more?
 – When you don’t know something, you feel tense, you think “Ah, I really want to know.”
 And when you find out so quickly, you feel relieved and happy — that it leads to results so quickly. That I don’t need to waste much time.
(28:34 - 28:48)
 – What’s your name?
 – Monika.
(28:51 - 29:19)
 If I may add something quickly — Monika also made me think of this: the app Google Lens is a classic example of artificial intelligence. A great example: I take a photo of a plant I’ve never seen before, and instantly I get all the information that exists about that plant. All the variations, and so on.
(29:20 - 29:37)
 Without it, I’d have to get a botany book and flip through it, probably without finding it. I have a gardening app too, but it takes way longer than Google Lens. Google Lens is much faster.
(29:38 - 29:52)
 The plant is just one example — you can use it for anything, candy or glasses. Anything Google Lens can scan.
 – Now it’s red, now it’s green.
(29:52 - 29:54)
 Okay, now I’d like a quiet table again.
Speaker 3:
 Just hold it here, it's written on the sharp disc. Should I go look for it? Or I’ll try translating and then it will give me the text.
That's what I'll take.
Speaker 2:
 I already had four questions.
Speaker 3:
 Where is this? Long time no see. He told me he was at the balls.
I always say, when I’m doing balls, that I always type in what I’m looking for. And then the kids said I don’t know anything about the sharp disc anymore. Do you want to tell something?
Speaker 4:
 Yes.
Speaker 1:
 The topic of AI is increasingly sneaking into everyday life. And I’m totally fascinated by it. But at the same time, when I think further about it, it seems to me like almost every technology.
Almost every technology has both positive and negative sides. And if you think it through theoretically, really to the end, it can get a bit unpleasant with AI. Namely, who takes control?
Who will seize control of this AI? And that worries me.
Otherwise, these everyday things are wonderful. The question will also be, in the future, all those office jobs will eventually be replaced. That means, social problems will arise, and no one knows how to solve them.
Because people will be released because they’re more or less redundant. Or they can be replaced by AI. A lot of things can be replaced by AI.
The keyword earlier was journalists. It was interesting also about condolence or mourning speeches. And it works in the office.
I’m an architect, and I notice that what was previously a creative process is now done by AI. And I’d say, well, it’s not so bad. And if you think it through, I feel like this whole thing reminds me of the sorcerer's apprentice, where a spell is cast, but you don’t know how to undo it.
And that worries me. Otherwise, it fascinates me completely. Because it’s really like a hammer.
A hammer you can use to build or you can smash something with it. And you can apply this idea to almost anything we interact with. And that’s the problem.
Who controls this story? So, yeah...
Speaker 4:
 So I heard worry and fascination. Fascination and worry.
Speaker 1:
 And partly fear, because when I... Based on my experience, it’s usually only the sly ones who take control of such things. They’re the...
I would say, completely neutrally, the sly ones. The really clever, sly ones. I could come up with a few names right now, but I’d rather not say them. And that... Well, that’s actually what scares me.
Speaker 4:
 So this fear or worry or this feeling of being concerned, and then this fascination, can you locate part of that in your body?
Speaker 1:
 So the fascination is definitely in the head. I’d say, these examples, you could translate them all wonderfully.
And really... I’m really impressed by that. But experience shows me that we’ll eventually have little fun with it because some people will take control of these topics.
And then I think we’ll have a problem that we don’t yet know how to solve.
Speaker 2:
 So I’m also more on his side, and I’m not even going into the future where jobs will disappear. That’s sure to happen. Maybe new ones will emerge.
But I’m focusing on the fact that the foundation for all AI is data that comes from somewhere. So my example, where I had my first encounter, was when visiting a friend who had an Alexa. He still has it today.
And anyway, in the context of our conversation, he was so enthusiastic and then said, “She knows everything,” and asked her, “Tell me how to get to Carola.” And she actually described the exact route. This means, first, surveillance of the space, meaning that thing hears everything and stores everything.
And he probably had my address in his contacts somewhere.
Speaker 5:
 Exactly, that’s how it is.
Speaker 2:
 This means, this AI links all sorts of things with data, my data, which I didn’t actively provide, so to speak. That made me a bit shocked. So more in the direction of being frightened and concerned, let’s say.
And that’s how it is today. All sorts of data, when they practice translating, that’s still a nice use case. But I’m saying, even in medicine, they’re now connecting all the CTs and things like that to help with diagnoses.
And I’m not entirely sure.
Speaker 3:
 Now with the new health cards, everything is saved on there.
Speaker 2:
 Yes, but that’s only mine.
Speaker 3:
 Yes, but everyone knows that. Everyone. They even brought it up that even if I hand my card to the pharmacist, they can read what diseases I have, which actually isn’t his business.
No, they have to see if the medication fits. Yes, they’ve already been criticized for that, for sharing some, but not others.
Speaker 4:
 Everyone gets it there. Yes, it’s very fast.
Speaker 2:
 I don’t pay attention to my body, it works, and that’s good. Yes, okay. Where, there, what?
Speaker 5:
 Where is the chair going?
Speaker 2:
 Yes, yes, gladly, but how would I leave that? In this circle.
Speaker 4:
 That was shocked, and so, what?
Speaker 2:
 Actually, more scared. Scared? Yes.
Concerned that my data is already out there, even though I never actively submitted it. And then this person enters the address. Yes, of course.
We took your address, maybe even your date of birth.
Speaker 3:
 For sure. And Carola’s date of birth, they can find that, it’s so easy.
Speaker 1:
 But it’s unavoidable. Everywhere. We leave our digital trace everywhere and constantly.
And the question will be, when will it be the case that, basically, in the future, it will be those who control the data, who control the truth about the data, who will have the power.
Speaker 2:
 So, it’s already happening in China. You get points systems there. That means Berlin is already under total surveillance.
This will come to us too. Everywhere, videos can be watched. And they have the societal points, and you can work them off.
If you want to work somewhere, you get minus points. For example. And you need a certain score to close a contract, for instance.
And then in the worst case, you can’t get a contract anymore, because you don’t have enough societal points, because you always throw trash on the street or whatever. They get plus and minus points for everything. And you have to have a certain level.
